# Totally Accurate Battlegrounds Stockmarket Page



## Description

Landfall Games AG plans a stockmarket feature for their currently BETA-released game Totally Accurate Battlegrounds, in which players can buy stock on their game performance, and make in-game purchases with the accumulated value. For this feature, the C#-based game is connected to Playfab, a database registrating player performance data. In cooperation with Landfall, I started working on a fictitious stockmarket page, that enables players to look up their stockmarket performance, as soon as the feature is implemented in the final project.
